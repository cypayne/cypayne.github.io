      <h1> Hello! </h1>
      <p>
          I am a Biology PhD candidate in the <a href="https://schumerlab.com/">Schumer lab</a> 
          at Stanford University, and I'm broadly interested in adaptive evolution and
          molecular ecology. Currently, I study the genetic basis of thermal tolerance,
          and how hybridization can facilitate adaptation to environmental stress, like 
          rising temperatures. Previously, I was a bioinformatician in the 
          <a href="https://palumbilab.sites.stanford.edu/">Palumbi lab</a> at
          Hopkins Marine Station (HMS), 
          and received my B.S. in marine biology, with a minor in computer science, from 
          UC San Diego.

      <p> Introducing swordtails (AKA <em>Xiphophorus</em>)! Flamboyant, charismatic,
          and easy to raise! They're
          an aquarium jewel, a biomedical model, and are simultaneously a cultural
          symbol. For me, one of the most amazing things about this group is that pairs
          of closely-related swordtail species naturally hybridize in rivers 
          flowing through the Sierra 
          Madre Oriental in central M&eacute;xico, resulting in parallel and independent
          hybrid zones throughout this region.

      <h2> The ecology </h2>
      <p> I'm broadly interested in the adaptations that equip populations to withstand
          environmental stress and change. I am especially fascinated by thermal 
          adaptations, and how populations are evolving as a result of climate change.
          <br><br>
          Two species of swordtail are particularly interesting to me because their
          thermal tolerance, or ability to withstand high temperatures, is 
          significantly different. In the wild, they inhabit the same 
          rivers - <em>X. malinche</em>
          live at high elevations in cooler mountain headwaters, while 
          <em>X. birchmanni</em> lives at low elevations in the warmer valleys.
          Perhaps as expected, <em>X. birchmanni</em> can withstand higher environmental
          temperatures than <em>X. malinche</em>, even when controlling for temperature
          acclimation in a common lab environment. 
          This suggests that there is a
          genetic basis for thermal tolerance in swordtails.
          <br><br>

          <!--<img class="cline-schematic" src="./images/therm-cline_schematic.png" height="350px" width="350px" /> -->
          <img class="cline-schematic" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pLYXuvzcwuXjOZF9fHY8XTKUkQ9fHHjy/view?usp=sharing" height="350px" width="350px" />
          These species overlap where their thermal habitat overlaps, typically 
          in the middle of these rivers. And, due to chemical runoff that
          impairs their ability to recognize members of their own species, these
          species have historically hybridized. Over time hybrids have mated with
          individuals from their parent species and with eachother,
          resulting in a gradient of high <em>X. malinche</em> ancestry in high elevation
          populations to high <em>X. birchmanni</em> ancestry in low elevation populations.
          As you might have guessed, this ancestry gradient (or ancestry cline) along
          each river
          corresponds with a thermal gradient, from cool temperatures to warmer 
          temperatures, AND a thermal tolerance gradient, from less thermal tolerant
          populations to tolerant populations (as shown by 
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02562.x">Culumber et al 2012</a>)!

      </p>

      <h2> The question </h2>
      <p> So what underlies thermal tolerance in this system? If you're familiar with the 
          molecular basis of stress responses, you know that the answer to this question is
          insanely complex. But, using a combination of genetic tools and functional 
          assays, I'm starting to detangle major explanatory genes and molecular
          pathways that contribute to evolved species-level differences in thermal
          tolerance in this system - and which may also show signal of adaptive movement from one
          species to the other.

          
      <h2> The support </h2>
      <p> Grad school is hard, and requires solid support. Introducing my trustworthy 
          companion, Cheb! She is extremely lazy and lounges on her hammock all day. She
          enjoys bugs and dislikes veggies.
