    <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
          The fodder of adaptation in animals has been classically attributed to variation 
          that already exists in the genome, or mutation. However, recently 
          it has become increasingly clear that there's another 
          common mechanism that introduces new adaptive variation 
          into populations: hybridization!

          <br><br>
          Hybridization is mating between species. In Biology class you probably learned that 
          a species is distinct because it specifically CAN'T mate with other species 
          (that's the "Biological Species Concept"). But actually it turns out that more than 25% 
          of all plant species can mate with at least one other species, and now we 
          know that over 10% of animal species can too 
          (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.010">Mallet 2005</a>)! So what even is a species? 
          This is 
          a spicy question with spicy debate that I won't dip into here, but here's a 
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/accumulating-glitches/
          do_species_really_exist/"> summary</a> of the ongoing dilemma.

          <br><br>
          I'm exploring how hybridization fascilitates adaptation to environmental stress
           - in particular, thermal stress. 
          A population's tolerance of its
          thermal environment is critically important to its survival. As temperatures rise
          globally, many populations are being forced to physically move to suitable thermal 
          habitat, rapidly adapt, or collapse. For many populations, including those of 
          riverine fishes like swordtails, relocating to
          thermally-suitable habitat isn't always possible. Selection on standing variation
          in the genome and mutations can take a long time to yield adaptions, perhaps 
          longer than it would take
          for climate change to exterminate a population. But hybridization offers a fast-track
          option.
          If hybrid offspring are able to mate with individuals from one of their parent species, 
          they can move genes from one species into the gene pool of the other, thereby 
          introducing novel adaptive variation into that species' genome. 
          Hybridization may provide the
          opportunity for thermal adaptations to move from resilient populations into
          more sensitive populations.

          <br><br>
          Swordtail fishes are the perfect model system for studying adaptation via hybridization, 
          both in the 
          lab and the field. Adored by hobbyists and scientists alike, 
          swordtails are live-bearing freshwater fishes that exhibit a wide range of vibrant 
          physical traits, which can be mix-n-matched between some hybridizing species. 
          Sometimes hybrids express phenotypes that are similar to those of one of their 
          parents, and sometimes they exhibit phenotypes that are intermediate (in 
          between) or extreme. For example, crosses between swordless and sworded 
          species (like <i>X. birchmanni</i> and <i>X. malinche</i>, respectively) result in hybrids 
          with intermediate sword lengths (we partially described 
          the genetic basis of the sword trait 
          <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.218164v1">here</a>).

          <br><br>
          Thermal tolerance, or the ability to withstand high temperatures, is
          another trait that is intermediately expressed in swordtail hybrids. 
          <i>X. birchmanni</i>, which lives in the warmer lowlands, has a significantly 
          higher thermal
          tolerance than <i>X. malinche</i>, the cooler highland species, even when controlling for 
          plasticity. This suggests that there is a genetic basis for this trait, and 
          therefore that 
          thermal adaptations could be passed from one species to the other, via hybridization. 
          
          <br>
          <!-- which can be mix-n-matched due to their ammenability to interspecies mingling. -->
          <h3><a>Uncovering the genetic basis of thermal tolerance</a></h3>
          Using a combination of genetics and biochemical approaches, such as QTL mapping,
          expression analysis, and functional assays, I am teasing apart the genes 
          and molecular pathways that explain variation in the thermal tolerance trait between
          <i>X. birchmanni</i> and <i>X. malinche</i>.

          <br>
          <h3><a>Tracking introgression of thermal adaptations along thermal clines</a></h3> 
          <i>X. birchmanni</i> and <i>X. malinche</i> form hybrid zones along rivers that have 
          thermal clines. As river temperatures warm, I predict that adaptive thermal 
          tolerance genes
          from the more thermally-resilient <i>X. birchmanni</i> populations may move into
          the more sensitive <i>X. malinche</i> populations. By
          looking for shifts in ancestry proportions at tolerance genes in natural
          populations along ancestry clines, I can pinpoint the <i>X. birchmanni</i>
          adaptations that 
          are likely to help wild populations survive climate change and that are
          compatible against an <i>X. malinche</i> genomic background.

          <br>
          <h3><a>Investigating the role of mitochondria in thermal adaptation</a></h3>
          It is clear that mitochondria play a non-trivial role in thermal
          tolerance in many systems. There are notable coding and expression differences 
          between <i>X. birchmanni</i> 
          and <i>X. malinche</i> mitochondrial genomes, as well as nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
          genes, that could explain differences in thermal tolerance between these species.

          Using <i>in vitro</i> functional and enzymatic assays, I am measuring differential
          mitochondrial activity and efficiency under variable thermal conditions.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Coral conservation genetics</button>
    <div class="collapseContent">
      <p>Some <i>A. hyacinthus</i> reef-building coral populations are more 
         resilient to heat stress than others. Using population 
         genetic and comparative genomics approaches, I worked on identifying 
         genetic markers that distinguish "strong", or heat resilient, corals.       
         This work may inform reef restoration and 
         management efforts by helping predict which populations will be 
         best-equipped to survive rising ocean temperatures.

    <div class="collapseContent">
      <p> Several Queen Conch populations in the Caribbean are 
          CITES-listed, meaning they are (or recommended to be) 
          protected against over-exploitation by an international 
          trade agreement. A central conservation problem is 
          identifying where conch in the trade were poached from, 
          so that the fishery can be managed accordingly. I worked 
          on developing a new tool using multiplex-PCR to quickly 
          and cheaply mass genotype informative markers, which can 
          be used to predict a conch's population origin.
